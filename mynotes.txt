###Launching the development server
    In the terminal, navigate to the project folder, then type the following:
    `ng serve --open`

    Doing this will generate and run the server, which we will use to test the
    application. 

###Setting up GIT
    After creating the repository, use the following command to connect the local 
    repository to gitup

    `git remote add origin "URL to repositry"`

    Once done, you can run general git commands, or use vscode's interface for 
    pushing changes into the repository.


###Generating a component
    Angular is comprised of components, and building an application is little 
    more than making each piece and putting them together.

    You can use the CLI to generate a component using the following command:

    `ng generate component "Component name"`

    You can also generate a service by replacing "component" with "service"

###Arranging components
    A component can be dropped into an .html file by putting in an element with
    the component selector. 

    As an example: `<app-heroes></app-heroes>` will drop the app-heroes component
    exactly where you put it. 

    In order for this to work, the component must be imported and declared in the
    module file.
