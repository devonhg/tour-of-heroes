###Launching the development server
In the terminal, navigate to the project folder, then type the following:
`ng serve --open`

Doing this will generate and run the server, which we will use to test the
application. 

###Setting up GIT
After creating the repository, use the following command to connect the local 
repository to gitup

`git remote add origin "URL to repositry"`

Once done, you can run general git commands, or use vscode's interface for 
pushing changes into the repository.


###Generating a component
Angular is comprised of components, and building an application is little 
more than making each piece and putting them together.

You can use the CLI to generate a component using the following command:

`ng generate component "Component name"`
